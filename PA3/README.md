The interpreter utilizes the information processed by the lexical analyzer and parser to execute the SPL language statements. It is able to handle statements such as 'writeln' for output and variable assignments/arithmetic for various data types including integers, characters, and strings. In addition, it also checks for any syntax errors located in those statements to prevent runtime errors from occurring. Without the intrepreter no execution of the code would be possible since the parser only translates the instructions but cannot actually execute them.
