Lexical Analyzer


The Lexical Analyzer I designed is used to meticulously scan text files, accurately identifying and categorizing tokens such as strings, integers, and constants. To add on, the analyzer also has the capability to recognize and ignore commented lines, ensuring they do not interfere with token processing. I incorporated logic to correctly handle and parse conditional 'if-else' statements, differentiating them from other tokens and comments.
