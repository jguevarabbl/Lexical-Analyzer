Lexical Analyzer

This first part of the project scans any potential tokens in text files such as for example, strings, integers, etc. Additionally, the analyzer can also differentiate and logic statements such as if statements as well as comparisons. The user also has the ability to add any commandline arguments such as -nconst, -sconst, -v, and -ident to list any favorable tokens.
